Hello! Thank you for visiting my website! My name is Will Moss, and I am majoring in Computer Science at 
Vanderbilt University, but I am currently studying abroad at University College Dublin. I made this website so that I
could share projects I am working on, updates about my time abroad, or anything else that I find exciting.
